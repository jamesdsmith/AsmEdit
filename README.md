# AsmEdit
This project aims to implement a basic IDE for editing a simple, stack based assembly language. This originally started out as a school project to create a bytecode intepreter, and I have just expanded from there over time.

##### Proposed features:

* Compile and run inside the editor (complete)
* Syntax Highlighting (somewhat complete)
* Debugging:
  * View memory inside IDE (somewhat complete)
  * Ability to step through code line at a time (not started)
  * View stack and see updates while stepping through code (not started)
* Tabbed editing (not started)
